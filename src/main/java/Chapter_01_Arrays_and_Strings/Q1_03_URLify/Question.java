/**
 * 1.3 URLify
 *      Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with "%20".
 *          You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold all the additional characters, and that
 *          you are given the "true" length of the string.
 *
 *       (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place)
 *
 *       EXAMPLE
 *          Input :   "Mr John Smith      ", 13
 *          Output:   "Mr%20John%20Smith"

    /**      Note: Java Strings are immutable
     *          We have implemented this problem using character arrays, because Java strings are immutable.
     *              If we used strings directly, the function would have to return a new copy of the string, but it would
     *              allow us to implement this in just one pass
     *
     *     Note: Null Terminated Strings `\0`
     *          A String is defined to be a fixed length sequence of char values
     *              All possible char values (from 0 to 65535 - char is 16-bit integer representing a Unicode-encoded character)
     *                  may be used in a String.
     *              There is no "distinguished" value that means that the string ends.
     *                  - So how they track string ending? Using length
     *
     *          The \0 in this case converts to 0o0 in octal, when this is converted to ASCII , reads as no string at all
     *          This suggests in Java \0 is not used to null terminate a string,
     *              and further research shows Java doesn't use anything to null terminate strings,
     *              as the length of the string is enough to tell it that it has reached the end of the string

     *                  - if there's a space: we replace it with "%20"
